# Frequentist-Inference

This repository is dedicated to writing Python code to apply the following statistical concepts:
the z-statistic
the t-statistic
the difference and relationship between the two
the Central Limit Theorem, including its assumptions and consequences
how to estimate the population mean and standard deviation from a sample
the concept of a sampling distribution of a test statistic, particularly for the mean
how to combine these concepts to calculate a confidence interval
sampling and calculating probabilities from a normal distribution
identifying the correct way to estimate the standard deviation of a population (the population parameter) from a sample
how to calculate critical values and confidence intervals
using the Central Limit Theorem to apply frequentist techniques to answer questions that pertain to very non-normally distributed data from the real world
performing inference using such data to answer business questions
forming a hypothesis and framing the null and alternative hypotheses
testing this hypothesis using a t-test
